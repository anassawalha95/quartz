The best way to avoid a failed campaign is to prevent it.

It starts with picking the right firm. 

Most creative firms have *no idea* how the development process actually works. They rarely ask what role they play in the bigger picture. Still, many developers pick their creative firms based on perception rather than logic. That primarily stems from a lack of understanding of exactly what to look for and why. 

This article gives you the framework to sort the good from the bad firms so you can have the most successful campaign possible. 

Note: Stick to the questions in order. They build off of one another, so if you get a “weak” answer early on, moving on to another firm will save you time.

#### 1. HOW WILL YOUR SERVICE INCREASE PROFIT?

From the outside, it may seem like it's an obvious and natural topic to discuss — especially if you come from the business world.

However, in the creative world, creatives have challenges with the stigma around money. While the professionals who make careers in marketing move past it, a lack of comfort discussing profits indicates their level of experience (and likely competency) within the industry. 

##### Qualities of a weak answer:

* Uncomfortable speaking about money.

Those who have money have no problems speaking about it - and if they have money, they must be a successful firm. That’s the compensation for the value they provide to the marketplace.

* Will defer to quality.

Generally, a firm that answers questions about profit with quality will give you nothing but execution. Execution alone does not make a successful campaign. Most anyone can execute an idea. The work itself does not increase the profitability of your project.

##### Qualities of a strong answer:

* They can show you past results

Any good firm knows *exactly* how they produce results within the bigger picture of a project. They likely built their service *directly* upon those results - rather than on quality alone.

#### **2. HOW WILL YOUR SERVICE SAVE US TIME?**

This question looks for the processes the firm has in place to make the service more effective for YOU. This can be through specific communication systems, review systems, and reports. 

E.g. Will they reduce meeting times? Will they make it easier for your to communicate with other shareholders?

These processes and procedures should back up the results stated in the first question.

##### Qualities of a weak answer:

* A 'similar' process to the rest of the industry.

This alone isn't bad. However, it just means you'll likely get a product that's the same as your competitors.

* A process that focuses on *their* work.

Similar to the last question, if they are focusing on *their* work and internal system, you know that they optimized for results in *their* process, not yours. An effective system focuses on the end goal *first* then works backward to figure out how to achieve that — achieve the best efficiency for YOU, not for them.

* Complex and difficult to explain.

No truly effective system is complex. If the firm can't explain it simply to you, they don't have an effective system.

##### Qualities of a strong answer:

* Definitive process with clear measurable results.

Exact stats, metrics, and processes ensure with a high probability of success for the project.

* Examples of a proven process that worked with previous clients.

A proven process may not strictly necessary. Working through a new system logically can ensure success, especially if your project offers unique scheduling or design challenges. 

However, a marketplace-tested system adds an extra layer of comfort. Note that price should be adjusted accordingly based on risk. So if it hasn’t been tested, their cost should be much lower. 

* Clear timelines.

More complex campaigns with more firms involved (particularly who have dependencies on key deliverables) make specific timelines especially important.

#### **3. WHAT'S YOUR STRATEGY FOR THE PROJECT?**

You would think having a strategy would be more common. 

Most firms think they have one. Some firms have one for themselves. Very few firms have one for you and for the biggest picture of the project. 

##### Qualities of a weak answer:

* Actually giving a response.

The challenge with this question lies in an inability to answer it without *knowing the* objectives of the project. Even if the answer seems obvious, a firm cannot make good decisions without the preliminary processes completed. The same way a doctor asks you questions regardless of the apparent symptoms. 

##### Qualities of a strong answer:

* Will set up an intentional call to go over it further.

Good firms will have a specific system in place to generate the strategy based on your *specific* project.

#### **4. HOW WILL YOUR SERVICE HELP US LONG-TERM?**

Once you determine that the firm focuses on making you money, can effectively diagnose your problems, and have a clear process for achieving your goals, you can now ask this “trick” question. 

It catches firms off-guard. Most project requirements don’t focus on long-term goals - as it’s not within the scope. However, a good firm becomes great when they can explain how they’ll help long-term. It classifies them as the one you ought to be working with for a long time. 

It signifies that they truly focus on helping *you* and *your* project. 

##### Qualities of a weak answer:

* They haven't thought about it.

Understand that this is *most* firms. Rarely do firms care about the impact of their work beyond the scope of delivery. If this is the case, ensure you have a system in place internally to ensure the product's utilization within your future touchpoints. E.g. How will the marketing team or the branding team use the renderings?

##### Qualities of a strong answer:

* They'll have real-life case studies.

This ensures consistency of effective delivery over a broad range of different projects.

* They'll have a separate service in place for this.

All great firms should have a process in place for post-delivery utilization and optimization. After all, what's the use of creating a phenomenal product if it's not utilized effectively?

##### If they've answered all these questions in a 'strong' fashion, you can be confident that this firm thinks beyond themselves and will be a good investment for you.
