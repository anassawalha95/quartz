**The key differences between an in-house creative department and a design firm.**

---

After studying over one thousand developments and speaking with over 100 developers, the evidence is clear.

An in-house creative department for architectural marketing campaigns ensures a quick route to mediocrity, reducing sales. 

Yet most developers still opt for an in-house creative department. They tend to believe it either saves time and money, or they’ll get a better visual at the end. 

The reality? Neither of these happen. 

Design agencies specialize in niches, which produces a greater incentive to produce better results. I will cover why this happens and the difference between in-house creative departments and specialist design agencies. 

## INCENTIVE STRUCTURE

### In-house

**In-house departments have no inherent incentive to grow.**

Creatives on an in-house team focus on abiding by the directions of the firm in which they work. 

Survival and maintenance of the existing structure become the principal obligation. Phrases like “Don’t rock the boat” or “This is the way we do things here” squash any creativity, ambition, and innovation that new team members might have brought to the project. 

What’s the point of moving beyond survival if no intrinsic rewards exist? 

Personal growth means more work for the same pay. 

As such, their systems tend to be outdated and inferior. Something particularly concerning given our society’s current rate of technological advancement. 

There are a few by-products of this phenomenon: 

* Failure to accurately diagnose the developers’ problems
* Higher prices for work below industry standards
* Inability to solve problems beyond the immediate project scope or expertise

By the way, that inability to solve problems beyond the creative’s immediate scope of work often hamstrings the entire project's success. 

To diminish incentives even further, sub-par work has almost no consequences for the architectural firm. Developers will still work with the architect even if their in-house visual team creates marketing material that looks like something rendered from 30-year-old CG software. 

In short, the reputation of the architectural firm protects the in-house team. The developer may not like the marketing material, but they don't want to risk the deal with a top-tier architecture firm. 

This further exacerbates the inherent complacency of the in-house creative departments. It’s a shame, really. 

### Design Firms

**The marketplace rewards design firms for exceptional results.**

The better their results, the more they grow. 

Design firms feel the rewards of a successful project. They become tangible reminders that rewards create an inherent imperative toward growth. 

A design firm exists to create and grow. That simply won’t happen if they don’t put their clients first and consistently solve their clients’ problems with speed and a clear ROI. 

The tangible rewards of success incentivize design first to invest in superior, modern systems that can accommodate the challenges of our times. 

Plus, the design firm and every single team member risks more since they operate in the open market. 

## PROJECT EXECUTION

### In-house

**In-house departments prioritize the needs of the firm they reside in over the developer.**

The existing structure results in teams operating as **executors** who simply take orders from developers or their superiors. (And I have yet to find an industry that doesn't joke about managers with no specialty in the skills of the team they manage - in this case, marketing, branding, or computer graphics.)

Creative executors fail to hit the *real* objectives because they aren’t expected (or rewarded) for diagnosing the *needs* (not wants) of the developer. 

Imagine a doctor prescribing you medication without taking the necessary precautions and asking you the right questions - let alone blindly trusting you when you say you want the medication from some commercial or what your friend liked. Yet, we allow creative teams this leeway when so many more lives depend on the success of the development.

*In-house teams commit creative malpractice by blindly executing what their non-creative manager says they want.* 

And just like (some) doctors, they will prioritize their own needs (profit and prescribing you a medication to meet a quota) over what's best for you. They focus on THEIR architectural features - rather than what’s best for a successful marketing campaign for the project. Granted, certain architectural features may help a campaign but will *not* increase the value of your development all by themselves. 

### Design Firms

**Design firms, by nature, must solve the needs of their developer directly.** 

They cannot exist in any other capacity and survive. 

Unlike the in-house team, they work directly with YOU - no middleman, no incentive difference among shareholders. 

A design firm must increase the value of your development *because that lets them keep the privilege of your business.* 

Increasing development value lets the design firm thrive in the open marketplace. Unlike the in-house team, they don’t work in a vacuum. Mistakes mean loss of business, and exceptional performance means tangible rewards. 

The inherent structural dynamic incentivizes the design firm to operate as **strategists** rather than executors. They take the reins as orchestrators, which allows you to be the owners you're supposed to be.

Deep marketing strategy understanding increases the value of the development more than any other marketing benefit. 

## **TALENT**

### In-house

**In-house departments have a difficult time attracting talent specific to that domain.**

Specialists know they have a marketable skill and take those skills to places that will reward them. That’s why they work for specialist firms. 

In-house teams save payroll by hiring generalists, student interns, or someone who does design and visuals *on the side*. Regardless of their background, the department manager might have an MBA but lacks practical knowledge of what makes a development sell. 

This works well for the architectural firm that can rely on the reputation of their architects. But it doesn’t benefit the developer. 

### Design Firms

**Highly specialized design firms attract highly specialized talent.**

For exactly that reason, developers typically work with a series of specialists, as opposed to one generalist. 

People would rather be part of a firm that specializes in their area of interest rather than work in a small branch of a firm that does something else. When someone dedicates their life toward mastering a specific skill, they naturally gravitate to an organization that puts that skill (and themselves) as a priority. 

Priority in specialization supports the specialist in increasing their skills, earning rewards for that dedication and providing a sense of fulfillment. 

It’s only natural for skilled creatives to opt for a specialty design firm.

##### **Like the creatives, developers opting for a specialized design firm will realize the same benefits because when accounts get tallied, in-house departments have no obligation to the reality of the market.**
