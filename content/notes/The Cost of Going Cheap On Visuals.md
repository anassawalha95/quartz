Have you ever picked the more “affordable” solution, only to regret it later? 

*We see this all the time.* 

A developer initially chose the cheapest option, trying to save money. Then they have to spend more money (even beyond the initial marketing budget) cleaning up the mess made by an inexperienced team.

##### When it comes to visuals, cheap costs more. 

Most developers know this. But it’s difficult to choose the higher quality option when comparing budget and profit margins. Rarely do they make the correct decision preemptively. 

But what if you literally have NO other options? What if you *have* to go with a “low budget?”

While I believe ALL campaigns should return an ample ROI (thus justifying the higher initial investment in a better firm), I also understand that funds may still be scarce and time sparse  — so sometimes you have to make the best with what you got.

In that case, consider these points when hiring and managing a creative team for the visuals in your marketing campaign. 

#### Quality over quantity.

Clichéd? Yes. But still…

A premium perception of your development should be the priority. Your ROI will increase by orchestrating two exceptional images rather than ten average images. (Although usually, they end up far below average.)

The goal is cohesion. No one looks at a single image and decides to buy. They look at the campaign as a whole and buy based on their feeling, which impacts their perception.

Anything below that premium perception of your development - even a single image - will destroy the feel of your building in the marketing materials. A quality visual storefront for your development creates the perception that the building will also be quality.

Conversely, when someone looks at cheap marketing materials, they will wonder where else the developer cut corners.

If you need to show more spaces, then:

#### Depict a clear message.

Developers often fall into the trap of “more is better,” cramming as much as possible into each view. It creates the opposite effect of its intention.

Busy images confuse the viewer with their lack of purpose. The viewer doesn’t know what they are supposed to look at, so information gets lost.

For example, imagine a commercial office space interior. Are you trying to show a client’s experience walking and getting a good impression of the company? Are you trying to show the technical features of the space? Are you trying to show the internal culture? You can’t have all three AND a compelling view.

By showing more, you reveal less.

Each view needs a purpose within the entire campaign.

If you have a large space requiring more views, then instead:

#### Utilize close-ups.

You can save money by reducing the content depicted in the scene.

Rather than display the entire café within an office space, take a close-up of just the kitchenette. Capture the feeling of someone about to enjoy a fresh cup of coffee right before work - the warm sunrise beaming through, the crisp aroma of freshly ground beans, and the tranquil moment before a zestful day of work.

People buy based on emotion, not features.

Evoke emotions more effectively through a smaller, more inexpensive view.

You can then utilize this technique to:

#### Ensure image utilization.

Are you familiar with the difference between image quality and image utilization in a marketing campaign? They serve different purposes.

A single, high-quality exterior rendering of the entire building may look nice initially, but it may not fit cohesively on your project’s homepage or marketing brochure. Typically, you would request a separate view. But if you want to save money while maintaining quality, choose a view that you know will work in ALL consumer touchpoints - e.g., a close-up of the building's façade or a key architectural feature.

Your marketing materials can then use cropped, zoomed-in, or overlay text on these images without losing its message. It also makes for a powerful intro that sparks the viewer’s curiosity, hooking them into viewing more.

Ensure this is done preemptively within the initial strategic overview to save the most time, and get the highest ROI.

##### At the end of the day, IF you have to go cheap, concentrate your resources toward a single goal to maximize the value of your visual marketing campaign.
